                <p>PETITION TO LORD STANLEY.</p>
                <p>A petition, which has been forwarded to</p>
                <p>Lord Stanley, asking him to exert his influence</p>
                <p>with a view to establishing penny postage</p>
                <p>between Egypt and the British Empire, has</p>
                <p>been signed by several hundred passengers on</p>
                <p>board the P. and 0. steamer Macedonia, out-</p>
                <p>ward bound for India, China, and Australia.</p>
                <p>The petition says it is naturally regarded as</p>
                <p>an irritating and anomalous burden that, while</p>
                <p>tho postage between Gibraltar, Malta, Aden,</p>
                <p>and India on the one l and and England on the</p>
                <p>other is one penny only, it should be still 2]d.</p>
                <p>between England and Port Said, Cairo, and</p>
                <p>Suez, and that there is reason to believe that</p>
                <p>the Egyptian Government and people are</p>
                <p>entirely favorable to the proposal for a penny</p>

                <p>General of Egypt, cordially approving of penny</p>
                <p>portage (universal). He adds that the cost to</p>
                <p>England would be, on the 1,200,000 letters to</p>
                <p>Egypt, £7,500-a mere bagatelle.</p>

                <p>expressing his regret at losing so smart a</p>

                <p>wrongful dismissal, was resumed this morning,</p>
                <p>when Me. Carton de Wiart continued his</p>
                <p>defence. His pleading, which was extremely</p>
                <p>eloquent, was supported by a number of docu-</p>
                <p>ments, which, he contended, proved that the</p>
                <p>Hon. A. J. Davey had all along been kept in</p>

                <p>WHERE IS THE FATHER ?</p>
                <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette.</p>
                <p>Sir,—In last night's “Egyptian Gazette"(Lo-</p>
                <p>cal and General) I read a short article concern-</p>
                <p>ing a young woman named Lettshorn, who was</p>
                <p>sentenced to two years’ imprisonment by the</p>
                <p>Native Assize Court in Cairo, for having killed</p>
                <p>her new born child. It is indeed a very sad</p>
                <p>case. Sadder still, that there should be a law</p>
                <p>inflicting punishment on the poor, seduced,</p>
                <p>perhaps hungry, girl-mother and not on the</p>
                <p>seducer. Why is his name not mentioned in</p>
                <p>the paper? Why should the young woman bear</p>
                <p>all the shame alone, and not share it with the</p>
                <p>man who shared her love? Justice was merciless</p>
                <p>to the heartless mother and lenient to the</p>
                <p>cowardly lover. Such sad cases will occur as</p>

                <p>L'A VBNT UR Hill E.</p>
                <p>M. Lambert’s company opened well and</p>
                <p>had, if not a full, at least a good house ever</p>
                <p>ready to respond to telling lines and good</p>
                <p>acting, and at times unwilling to reserve its</p>
                <p>applause at the close of an act. That M.</p>
                <p>Lambert's company would do well was expected.</p>
                <p>but no one, in our opinion, counted on hearing</p>
                <p>the parts of Fabrics and Clorinde so brilliantly</p>
                <p>upheld. M. Albert Lambert fils rendered the</p>
                <p>first role with real power; Mlle Delvair as</p>
                <p>Clorinde was brilliant She possesses a fine pre-</p>
                <p>sence, great powers of facial expression, and one</p>
                <p>of those rich voices, so rarely heard, that make</p>
                <p>movement and gesture almost needless when</p>
                <p>they express emotion or passion, so perfect it</p>
                <p>the charm of their intonation. M. Albert</p>
                <p>Lambert pere as Annibal was good, and M.</p>
                <p>Marqnet played his part with dignity—perhaps</p>
                <p>with too much reserve—for the role of a</p>
                <p>distinguished old gentleman who is ready to</p>
                <p>throw himself at the feet of a handsome girl</p>
                <p>with a pathetic certainty that she reciprocates</p>
                <p>his flame, Is rather on the comic side.</p>

                <p>THE TOMBAC MONOPOLY.</p>
                <p>WHY NOT ABOLISH IT?</p>
                <p>The abolition-of the salt monopoly (states</p>
                <p>"A1 Express") has given great satisfaction</p>
                <p>throughout Egypt; and the Government, which</p>
                <p>has deserved the best thanks of the people for</p>
                <p>this action, mast recognize the great harm</p>
                <p>caused by monopolies. Therefore we seize this</p>
                <p>opportunity (adds our contemporary) to draw</p>
                <p>the attention of the Government and of Lord</p>
                <p>Cromer, the great reformer of Egypt, to the</p>
                <p>tombac trade, which has been for 30 years ,a</p>
                <p>monopoly in Egypt. Tombac is so much used</p>
                <p>here that it ought to be considered one of the</p>
                <p>indispensable wants of the people. This mono-</p>
                <p>poly has so far caused great harm to the</p>
                <p>finauces of our country, and our wise reformer</p>
                <p>and the high authorities could put an end to</p>
                <p>it, as they have done to the salt monopoly.</p>

                <p>While there is so much discussion going on</p>
                <p>among the playgoing magnates of Alexandria</p>
                <p>as to what is eventually to take the place of</p>
                <p>the Z'zinia Theatre, we might point out a</p>
                <p>precedent for Alexandria in the great scheme</p>
                <p>we hear of from New York. Thirty prominent</p>
                <p>men have subscribed £600,000 for the building</p>
                <p>of a fine theatre, and a committee of their</p>
                <p>wives will determine who shall be privileged to</p>
                <p>pay £20,000 apiece for the boxes. If thirty</p>
                <p>public-spirited capitalist; patrons of the opera</p>
                <p>were to do likewise at Alexandria, and the</p>
                <p>Municipality were to turnish a fine site, we</p>
                <p>should have a theatre worthy of Egypt’s com-</p>

                <p>the necessity of waging war against the</p>
