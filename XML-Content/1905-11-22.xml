                    <head>THE SUCRERIES CASE.</head>
                    <head>HEATED ARGUMENTS. </head>
                    <p>The action brought by M. Poutrel against the Hon. A. J. Davey for wrongful
                        dismissal came before Judge Herzbruch yesterday morn ing, as was briefly
                        announced yesterday. The other members of the Court were Judges Vasquez and
                        Goracuchi, Fuad Bey Gross, and Youssef Bey Aziz. The defence was opened by
                        Me. Carton de Wiart, who pleaded with great eloquence and vigour. After
                        declaring that M. Pontrel’s action was inspired by personal malice, he
                        described the proceed- ings of the plaintiff as unfair and disloyal
                        throughout. M. Poutrel, after a violent per- sonal attack on the plaintiff
                        in the columns of the local Press, had left the country, in the possesion of
                        documents that be had secured in the most unjustifiable manner, without
                        daring to prove bis allegations personally. As for his dismissal, that was
                        the act not of the Hon. A. J. Davey, but of the company’s acting manager
                        obeying the orders of his board.</p>
                    <p>Turning to M. Poutrel’s conduct, Me. Car- ton de Wiart pointed out that if
                        the employes of the Sucreries Company had lied to the defendant, they had
                        lied in accordance with the instructions of MM. Poutrel and Ninci Ever since
                        1901 defendant bad complained that no communications had been made to him
                        directly, and it was a striking fact that none of the bills, acceptances,
                        etc., that M. Poutrel concealed bore defendant’s signature. That M. Poutrel
                        had kept the Hon. A. J. Davey in the dark was abundantly proved by certain
                        letters and documents which were read in Court, while his conduct in
                        destroying copies of numerous letters was most suspicious. The late M. de la
                        Bouglise, in a letter written five days before his death, declared that even
                        be did not know why the 18,000,000 fr. of the Cronier bills had been
                        accepted. No one knew fully but Nirci, Poutrel, and Cronier what was going
                        or, and defendant and other mem- bers of the board had been victimised.</p>
                    <p>Me Guilbaumou replied on the same lines as those which be followed in his
                        speech on Tuesday last The Hon. A. J. Davey's igno- rance was assumed—a
                        pose, in fact—and if he had realised a single fact he most have realis- ed
                        the whole situation. His failure was due either to complete ignorance or to
                        the fact that he wilfully closed his eyes to facts. The evidence supported
                        the latter alternative, and that being so defendant had no right whatever to
                        dismiss M. Poutrel. In the course of a question to counsel for the
                        plaintiff, Me. Carton de Wiart made the remark that if M. Poutrel returned
                        to Egypt he would have him arrested within 24 hours. Me. Gailhau- mou
                        replied that he would break the Dews to his client, and shortly afterwards,
                        at 11 am., the Court rose.</p>

                    <p>As the Sardinia was leaving for Liverpool, owing to some as yet unexplained

                        manufacturers will make a display of their products and send them around the
                        world on a 60,000 mile trip, which will take up about 15 months. This
                        itinerary provides for stops at ports of the most import tant commercial
                        countries of the world. The steamer will sail from New York about the end of
                        March and will first visit English, Scotch, and Irish ports, then going on
                        to the Continent, after which she will enter the Mediterranean and call at

                        merchants and others interested in handling American products. Invitations
                        will be sent out to desirable persons to inspect the display. The plan,

                    <p>V. Hugo nous a laisse dans ses cenvres des types immortals qui tiennent
                        d’ailleurs beau- coup plus de la fiction que la realite. Mais de tous ces
                        personnages, pour la plupart heroi- comiques, celui de Don. Cesar de Bazan
                        est certainement le mieux defini et le pins original. II etait donc tout
                        indique ponr servir de sujet au drame de M.M. Dumanoir et Dennery, qui n’ont
                        pourtant pas su conserver au type tout son cachet d’originalite. </p>
                    <p>Q. Salvini a ete excellent dans le role de Don Cesar, ce noble aventurier,
                        peu rigoureux dans ses mceurs mais qui n’en conserve pas moins de bons
                        sentiments. Mme Ida Salvini a partage son success. M.M- Diaz. Olivieri,
                        Peizaglia sa sont distingues dans leurs rules respectifs.</p>
                    <p>A l’occasion de son depart la troupe a été fort acclamee par le public.</p>

                    <p>General Mirza Faradjallah Khan, late Per- sian Diplomatic Agent and Consul
                        General in Egypt, and now Minister for Persia in the Caucasus, will arrive
                        shortly at Cairo, where he intends to spend the season.</p>
                    <p>The engagement is announced of Colonel Gorringe, C.M.G., D.S.0., to Miss
                        Ferelith Ramsay, younger daughter of Sir James Ramsay, of Banff, and sister
                        to the Marchio- ness of Tullibardine. Colonel Gorringe was appointed
                        Governor of the Sennar (Sudan) province in 1902. He joined the Egyptian Army
                        in l893 and to 1895 was appointed D.A.A.G. to the Headquarters’ Staff. He
                        was on the staff of the General Officer commanding the forces at the Abon
                        Hamed and Atbara actions, and commanded the irregulars at the actions of
                        Abou Adel and Om Debrikat, which saw the death of the Khalifa. He also saw
                        much active service in the Boer war and was at the relief of Kimberley,
                        Paardeberg, and Johanre burg. The future bride provided the title of
                        "Ferelith” for Lord Kilmarnock’s somewhat fantastic novel, and belongs to
                        one of the oldest Perthshire families. Her late mother was saved from death
                        by the devotion of an ayah during the Indian Mutiny.</p>
