                    <p>King Christian's reception of the deputation of the Storthing, sent to notify
                        Prince Charles of his election, and to ask the King's assent, was an
                        impressive and brilliant ceremony. The King, having assented, tamed deeply
                        moved to the Prince and Princess and exhorted them to serve their now
                        country loyally, and to win the love of the people. “Yon will," he conclud-
                        ed, "take with you the blessing of your aged King and grandfather, for
                        yourselves and your people.”</p>
                    <p>Prince Charles, as King Hakon VII., sub- sequently received the greetings of
                        the Nor- wegians at his own Palace. He declared that he and his consort
                        would devote their lives for Norway’s good. His motto would be : "All for
                        Norway.” (Reuter)</p>

                    <p>The “Daily Telegraph” learns from Tokio that the Anglo Chinese treaty with
                        regard to Tibet has been signed. It is believed that England acknowledges
                        Chinese sovereignty in Tibet, in return for which China pays an indemnity.

                    <head>PETITION TO LORD STANLEY.</head>
                    <p>A petition, which has been forwarded to Lord Stanley, asking him to exert his
                        influence with a view to establishing penny postage between Egypt and the
                        British Empire, has been signed by several hundred passengers on board the
                        P. and 0. steamer Macedonia, out- ward bound for India, China, and
                        Australia. The petition says it is naturally regarded as an irritating and
                        anomalous burden that, while tho postage between Gibraltar, Malta, Aden, and
                        India on the one l and and England on the other is one penny only, it should
                        be still 2]d. between England and Port Said, Cairo, and Suez, and that there
                        is reason to believe that the Egyptian Government and people are entirely
                        favorable to the proposal for a penny postage.</p>

                        bad a letter from his Excellency Saba Pasha, Postmaster- General of Egypt,
                        cordially approving of penny portage (universal). He adds that the cost to
                        England would be, on the 1,200,000 letters to Egypt, £7,500-a mere
                        bagatelle.</p>

                    <head>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette.</head>
                    <p>Sir,—In last night's “Egyptian Gazette"(Lo- cal and General) I read a short
                        article concern- ing a young woman named Lettshorn, who was sentenced to two
                        years’ imprisonment by the Native Assize Court in Cairo, for having killed
                        her new born child. It is indeed a very sad case. Sadder still, that there
                        should be a law inflicting punishment on the poor, seduced, perhaps hungry,
                        girl-mother and not on the seducer. Why is his name not mentioned in the
                        paper? Why should the young woman bear all the shame alone, and not share it
                        with the man who shared her love? Justice was merciless to the heartless
                        mother and lenient to the cowardly lover. Such sad cases will occur as long
                        as society will allow partiality in law. It is time some laws were
                        reformed.</p>

                    <p>M. Lambert’s company opened well and had, if not a full, at least a good
                        house ever ready to respond to telling lines and good acting, and at times
                        unwilling to reserve its applause at the close of an act. That M. Lambert's
                        company would do well was expected. but no one, in our opinion, counted on
                        hearing the parts of Fabrics and Clorinde so brilliantly upheld. M. Albert
                        Lambert fils rendered the first role with real power; Mlle Delvair as
                        Clorinde was brilliant She possesses a fine pre- sence, great powers of
                        facial expression, and one of those rich voices, so rarely heard, that make
                        movement and gesture almost needless when they express emotion or passion,
                        so perfect it the charm of their intonation. M. Albert Lambert pere as
                        Annibal was good, and M. Marqnet played his part with dignity—perhaps with
                        too much reserve—for the role of a distinguished old gentleman who is ready
                        to throw himself at the feet of a handsome girl with a pathetic certainty
                        that she reciprocates his flame, Is rather on the comic side.</p>

                        caused by monopolies. Therefore we seize this opportunity (adds our
                        contemporary) to draw the attention of the Government and of Lord Cromer,
                        the great reformer of Egypt, to the tombac trade, which has been for 30
                        years ,a monopoly in Egypt. Tombac is so much used here that it ought to be
                        considered one of the indispensable wants of the people. This mono- poly has
                        so far caused great harm to the finauces of our country, and our wise
                        reformer and the high authorities could put an end to it, as they have done

                        the building of a fine theatre, and a committee of their wives will
                        determine who shall be privileged to pay £20,000 apiece for the boxes. If
                        thirty public-spirited capitalist; patrons of the opera were to do likewise
                        at Alexandria, and the Municipality were to turnish a fine site, we should
                        have a theatre worthy of Egypt’s com- mercial capital.</p>

                        be greatly to enhance the reputation of Egypt as a resort for the tourist
                        and invalid. At present even the temper of a Mark Tapley's not proof agains
                        the irritability caused by the injection of the poison from their

                    <p>Succh is to be the title of Sir Eldon Gorst’s contribution to “The Empire and
                        the Century," which Mr. Murray is publishing. It is not so much a, highly
                        original volume as a library of Imperial essays compressed into a single
                        work. The first part deals with the Imperial organism as a whole, its
                        mechanism and prin- ciples ; and the second with the many con- stituents of
                        the Empire. The contributors make up a brilliant and representative list,
                        and Egypt and the Sadan occupy a good place in the second portion, “Realms
                        in Trust," of Part II., which deals with ''Constituents of Empire." Sir
                        William Garstin writes on "The Longest River in tie World,” the Hon. Sidney
                        Peel’s contribution deals with British rule in the Sudan, and Mr. Grogan
                        writes on “The Nile as I saw it.”</p>
